# fast_detector_Response

The aim of this program is to simulate the Readout system of the GRAIN (GRanular Argon fot Interctions of Neutrinos) module, part of the SAND (System for on-Axis Neutrino Detection) detector of the DUNE experiment for neutrino detection.
GRAIN is a vessel containing ~1 ton of liquid Argon (LAr) in which neutrinos can interact. The charged particles generated in these interactions move inside the LAr emmitting scintillation light, which is detected by SiPMs placed on the walls of the vessel.
